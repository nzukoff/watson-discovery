My first query is to check for books about Unsupervised Learning that have a topic on Clustering.

For the second query, I was curious about how many books had material on Unsupervised Learning but had negative sentiments. I wanted to know which books to avoid. Since the negative sentiment is on the review, not the book, I aggregated by book title.

Finally, I wanted to see all books that contain something about clustering with a Positive sentiment greater than 80%.

In all of my queries, I return a dictionary with the title of the book as the key and the price of the book as the value.
